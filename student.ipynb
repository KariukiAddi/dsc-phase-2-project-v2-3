    "The regression coefficients represent the relationship between each independent variable and the target variable (price). In simpler terms, they indicate how much each factor contributes to the predicted price of a house. Let's break down the coefficients and evaluation metrics in more detail:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Coefficients:\n",
    "   - \"Floors\" coefficient: This suggests that for each additional floor in a house, the predicted price increases by approximately 1.26e-10. In other words, houses with more floors tend to have higher prices.\n",
    "   - \"Condition\" coefficient: A higher condition rating is associated with a predicted price increase of around 7.57e-11. This implies that houses in better condition are generally priced higher.\n",
    "   - \"Grade\" coefficient: A one-unit increase in the grade rating corresponds to a predicted price increase of about 5.64e-11. Grades represent the overall quality of construction and design, so higher-grade houses are expected to have higher prices.\n",
    "   - \"Total_sqft\" coefficient: The negative value (-1.14e-13) suggests that, on average, each additional square foot of total square footage results in a very small decrease in the predicted price. Therefore, the size of the house does not have a significant impact on the price.\n",
    "   - \"Bed_bath_ratio\" coefficient: A higher ratio of bedrooms to bathrooms leads to a predicted price increase of approximately 4.49e-11. Houses with a greater number of bedrooms compared to bathrooms tend to have higher prices.\n",
    "   - \"Price_zscore\" coefficient: This is the most influential coefficient. For each unit increase in the price z-score, which measures the deviation from the average price, the predicted price increases by 367,368.14. This means that houses priced higher than the average have a substantial impact on the predicted price.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Evaluation Metrics:\n",
    "   - The mean squared error (MSE) measures the average squared difference between the predicted prices and the actual prices. In this case, the MSE is extremely small, around 1.81e-17, indicating that the model's predictions are very close to the actual prices.\n",
    "   - R-squared: With a value of 1.0, the model explains 100% of the variability in house prices using the selected independent variables. This indicates that the included factors (floors, condition, grade, total square footage, bed-bath ratio, and price z-score) successfully capture the variations in house prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can conclude that factors such as the number of floors, condition, grade, and the ratio of bedrooms to bathrooms have a modest impact on the predicted price. The size of the house, represented by the total square footage, does not play a significant role in determining the price. However, the price z-score, which measures how the price deviates from the average, has a strong influence on the predicted price. The model's predictions are highly accurate, closely matching the actual prices, and the selected variables collectively explain all the variations in house prices."

    "\n",
    "5. **Bed-Bath Ratio**: The coefficient value of 2.8941258575462396e-08 suggests that the ratio of bedrooms to bathrooms in a house has a relatively small impact on the house price. This implies that the specific combination of bedrooms and bathrooms may not be a major factor in determining the price for the target audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Price Z-score**: The coefficient value of 0.9999998623091368 indicates that the price z-score has a strong influence on the house price. A z-score measures how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean. This suggests that the standardized price value, relative to the mean, is a critical factor in determining the house price for the target audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "These insights can help the audience understand the factors that are more or less influential in determining house prices. For example, they can prioritize factors such as the price z-score and total square footage when assessing house prices. On the other hand, they may not need to focus much on features like floors, condition, and grade when making pricing decisions. Overall, these insights can assist the audience in making informed decisions related to buying, selling, or valuing houses in their market."
